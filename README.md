# SOLSTAR : SOLar Simulation of Thermal and Active Radio emissions

**SOLSTAR** (**SOL**ar **S**imulation of **T**hermal and **A**ctive **R**adio emissions) is a simulation tool for simulating solar radio emissions at GHz frequencies. It is designed to simulate spectral image cube at user given frequency range and frequency resolution at any observation date based on extreme ultraviolet observations of the Sun.

## üåü Features

- **GHz Frequency Simulation**: Simulate solar radio emissions in the GHz range.
- **Visibility simulation**: Simulate visibility of a given radio interferometric array.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Configure frequency ranges, frequency and temporal resolutions, and spatial resolution. 
- **Data Export**: Export simulation images in FITS and visibilities in CASA measurement format.
- **Modular Architecture**: Integrates seamlessly with other solar physics tools and workflows.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Basic Simulation
1. Edit the configuration file (`config.json`) to specify your simulation parameters:
   - Frequency range (e.g., `1 GHz - 10 GHz`)
   - Time intervals
   - Solar activity models
2. Run the simulation:
   ```bash
   python starsim.py --config config.json
   ```
3. Access the results in the `output/` folder.

### Advanced Options
- Enable real-time visualization:
  ```bash
  python starsim.py --visualize
  ```
- Export data in a specific format (e.g., FITS):
  ```bash
  python starsim.py --output-format fits
  ```
- Debug mode for detailed logs:
  ```bash
  python starsim.py --debug
  ```
